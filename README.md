## Team Process ##

### Using Waffle:

* Put an 'M' in front of MVP issues; add 'MVP' label.
* Stretch goals get the 'enhancement' label

### Github/Git Flow:

* Branch names should include  the **issue number** (e.g event-listeners#22), so we can tell who is working on what.
* After 5 pull requests, all work stops. Merge Party!
* Merge Party at the start (after standup meeting) and end of every day (5pm).
* Git push in alpha order: David, Erica, Logan, Val.

### General Stuff:

* Clear comments on all code so others can tell what it does.
* If you see a variable name, etc., that is not self-explanatory, ask about it!
