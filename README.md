## Team Process ##

### Using Waffle:

* Put an 'M' in front of MVP issues, followed by the next issue #.
* Move an item into 'In Progress' on Waffle BEFORE starting a new branch, so work doesn't get duplicated?

### Github:

* Branches should be named after the **issue number**, so we can tell who is working on what.
* After 5 pull requests, all work stops. Merge Party!
* Merge Party at the start (after standup meeting) and end of every day (5pm).

### General Stuff:

* Clear comments on all code so others can tell what it does.
* If you see a variable name, etc., that is not self-explanatory, ask about it!
