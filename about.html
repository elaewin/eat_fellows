          <h3>Erica</h3>
          <p>Erica's life is a weird dichotomy between the old and the modern. When she's not creating one of mankind's oldest pieces of technology, she spends a lot of time playing games of all different kinds. Also, there is no kind of pie that Erica does not like (except peach, which was awkward when she lived in the South.)</p>

          <h3>Logan</h3>
          <p>Heyo! When not watching anime or playing video games, you can probably find Logan cooking!  Food is a passion of his, so finding good food to eat is a big deal! He's excited that we are able to contribute to Code Fellows in some way, and help people find the food they want to eat!</p>

          <h3>Val</h3>
          <p>A former Project Manager, Val has been working in tech since the 80s. Started out with a company that did CGI for the original “Tron” movie. Her next career will be about solving problems in Healthcare IT. Off hours are spent volunteer-working and raising a frenzied young hound dog. Food preferences: gluten-free, no shellfish, and extra cheese.
